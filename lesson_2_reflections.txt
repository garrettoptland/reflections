What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates an empty hidden folder called .git
	Need to do it so Git can store all the metadata and information of your commits in the repository
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It doesn't hold all of the files in the repository, only the ones you add that you want to commit.
	It allows you to commit only the files you've made changes to.
