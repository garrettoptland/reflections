When would you want to create a remote directory rather than keeping all your work local?

	When sharing your work for collaborating with other people. Or sharing it to the public.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	In case someone contributes anything unecessary, broken or malicious to your repository you don't want to add that without checking their changes first. Also their changes might overwrite some of your code

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are used only on GitHub. Used so you can extend or improve someone else's repository while still giving them credit
	Clones can be done locally or from GitHub to local
	Branches can be represented anywhere as they're just apart of repositorys in general

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	That way everything is up to date and if any more changes are added and conflicts arise, checking the conflicts won't be as big a task.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Could use dropbox and simply notify and email people which file I'm working on. Dropbox would be a bit easier, since it has some features of Git not allowing multiple edits at the same time
	But for any project that is quite large or has a lot of contributors all other methods aren't really feasible.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	When you're trying a different feature or approach, or something that might break the project.
	Can be good to keep experimental or different elements compartmentalised.
	Could also get out of hand if there's too many branches that have changes in the same files that could conflict and make merging very difficult.
