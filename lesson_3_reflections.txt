When would you want to create a remote directory rather than keeping all your work local?

	When sharing your work for collaborating with other people. Or sharing it to the public.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	In case someone contributes anything unecessary, broken or malicious to your repository you don't want to add that without checking their changes first. Also their changes might overwrite some of your code

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are used only on GitHub. Used so you can extend or improve someone else's repository while still giving them credit
	Clones can be done locally or from GitHub to local
	Branches can be represented anywhere as they're just apart of repositorys in general
